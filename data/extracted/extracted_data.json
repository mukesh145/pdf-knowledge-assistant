      "© GitHub Neural Networks Created On: Mar 24, 2017 | Last Updated: May 06, 2024 | Last Verified: Nov 05, 2024 Neural networks can be constructed using the torch. nn package. Now that you had a glimpse of autograd, nn depends on autograd to define models and differentiate them. An nn. Module contains layers, and a method forward(input) that returns the output. For example, look at this network that classifies digit images: Cat. S$ 16@ 10x10 mp Set. C1: feature maps 6@28x28 I Full conection | Gaussian connections Subsampling Convolutions | Subsampling Full connection convnet It is a simple feed-forward network. It takes the input, feeds it through several layers one after the other, and then finally gives the output. A typical training procedure for a neural network is as follows: Define the neural network that has some learnable parameters (or weights) Iterate over a dataset of inputs Process input through the network Compute the loss (how far is the output from being correct) Propagate gradients back into the networkʼs parameters Update the weights of the network, typically using a simple update rule: weight = weight - learning_rate * gradient https: //docs. pytorch. org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/neural_networks_tutorial. html 1/9 11/26/25, 11: 51 AM Neural Networks -- PyTorch Tutorials 2. 9. 0+cu128 documentation",

The entire torch. nn package only supports inputs that are a mini-batch of samples, and not a single sample. For example, nn. Conv2d will take in a 4D Tensor of nSamples x nChannels x Height x Width. If you have a single sample, just use input. unsqueeze(0) to add a fake batch dimension. Before proceeding further, letʼs recap all the classes youʼve seen so far. Recap: torch. Tensor - A multi-dimensional array with support for autograd operations like backward(). Also holds the gradient w. r. t. the tensor. nn. Module - Neural network module. Convenient way of encapsulating parameters, with helpers for moving them to GPU, exporting, loading, etc. nn. Parameter - A kind of Tensor, that is automatically registered as a parameter when assigned as an attribute to a Module. autograd. Function - Implements forward and backward definitions of an autograd operation. Every Tensor operation creates at least a single Function node that connects to functions that created a Tensor and encodes its history. At this point, we covered: Defining a neural network Processing inputs and calling backward",

There are several different loss functions under the nn package. A simple loss is: nn. MSELoss which computes the mean-squared error between the output and the target. For example: output = net(input) target = torch. randn(10) # a dummy target, for example target = target. view(1, -1) # make it the same shape as output criterion = nn. MSELoss() loss = criterion(output, target) print(loss) Out: tensor(1. 4512, grad_fn=<MseLossBackward0>) Now, if you follow loss in the backward direction, using its. grad_fn attribute, you will see a graph of computations that looks like this: input -> conv2d -> relu -> maxpool2d -> conv2d -> relu -> maxpool2d -> flatten -> linear -> relu -> linear -> relu -> linear -> MSELoss -> loss So, when we call loss. backward(), the whole graph is differentiated w. r. t. the neural net parameters, and all Tensors in the graph that have requires_grad=True will have their. grad Tensor accumulated with the gradient. For illustration, let us follow a few steps backward: print(loss. grad_fn) # MSELoss print(loss. grad_fn. next_functions[0][0]) # Linear print(loss. grad_fn. next_functions[0][0]. next_functions[0][0]) # ReLU https: //docs. pytorch. org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/neural_networks_tutorial. html https: //docs. pytorch. org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/neural_networks_tutorial. html 5/9 11/26/25, 11: 51 AM Neural Networks -- PyTorch Tutorials 2. 9. 0+cu128 documentation",
