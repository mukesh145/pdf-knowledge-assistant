      "Synthesis and Characterization of Postsulfonated Poly(arylene ether sulfone) Diblock Copolymers for Proton Exchange Membranes Fuel Cell Laboratory, Nissan Research Center, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., 1 Natsushima-cho, Yokosuka-shi, Kanagawa 237-8523, Japan Received 10 November 2007; accepted 30 October 2008 DOI: 10.1002/pola.23181 Published online in Wiley InterScience (www.interscience.wiley.com). ABSTRACT: Sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) diblock copolymers were studied through the postsulfonation process. Two kinds of hydrophobic oligomers with a mol- ecular weight of 20 kDa were prepared in advance as block sequences and then coupled together to obtain diblock copolymers. One oligomer was synthesized from bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) sulfone (BHPS) and 4,40-diﬂuorodiphenyl sulfone (DFDPS), which was thought to be incapable of postsulfonation. The other oligomer was syn- thesized from hydroquinone (HQ) and 4,40-dichlorodiphenyl sulfone (DCDPS), which successfully proceeded to a hydrophilic sequence as a result of sulfonation onto the HQ moiety after the coupling reaction. Consequently, a diblock copolymer with high molecular weight was obtained; although its intrinsic viscosity was too low to form a tough membrane because of its high rigidity and high crystallinity. Therefore, the use of decaﬂuorobiphenyl (10F) as a termination reagent was investigated with the aim of achieving higher coupling reactivity and a kinky property. As a result, a sulfo- nated diblock copolymer was successfully obtained with sufﬁcient molecular weight and intrinsic viscosity to form the membrane, as well as with adequate thermal pro- perties. It was observed that proton conductivity, water uptake, and the water diffu- sion coefﬁcient increased with higher ion exchange capacity. VVC 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci Part A: Polym Chem 47: 700–712, 2009 For the last several decades, there has been increasing interest in polymer electrolyte mem- brane (PEM) fuel cells for application as station- ary, transportation, and portable power sources.1 Extensive research efforts have produced a wide variety of PEMs such as perﬂuorinated\n",

In recent years, many researchers have been searching for ways to com- pensate for this low PC such as by providing microphase separations. For direct-methanol fuel cell (DMFC) applications, a number of block copolymers based on poly(styrene-co-olefin) have been developed, resulting in better selectivities, yet they still have some inherently similar prob- lems to those of PSA membranes, because of their lower thermal stability than engineering plas- tics.° Recently, McGrath et al.7° have proposed that multiblock copolymers based on PES consist- ing of hydrophilic and hydrophobic sequences could improve PC under low RH because of the formation of continuous effective proton paths. However, there is a problem in synthesizing such multiblock copolymers via a polycondensation reaction because of the poor coupling reactivity between the two oligomers, which results in a lower molecular weight than that needed to form tough membranes. Considering the nucleophilic- ity of the terminated structures, poly(imide) type block copolymers can be easily polymerized; although the issue of hydrolysis has not been thoroughly resolved so far.!°-!% Therefore, the aim of this study was to enhance the reactivity of the coupling reaction by using Therefore, the aim of this study was to enhance the reactivity of the coupling reaction by using two hydrophobic oligomers that can be expected to provide more mutual miscibility than hydro- philic–hydrophobic oligomers, as well as highly reactive ﬂuorine-extermination moieties instead of chlorine.7,14–16 With regard to the raw material cost, hydroquinone (HQ), as a commercially avail- able dihydroxyl monomer, is more readily usable, compared with even well-known monomers such as biphenol, bisphenol A, and bisphenol AF. Some researchers have been investigating the use of a sulfonated HQ monomer17,18 or a postsulfona- tion process after polymerization,19 but these approaches have\n",

The AFM images in Fig- ure 15 also conﬁrmed the phase separation of the hydrophobic region (light color) and hydrophilic region (dark color), indicating that both partially continuous and isolated phase separations exist. In summary, both PC and the water self-diffusion coefﬁcient were lower than we expected, because of the strength of proton association that is de- pendent on the chemical structure, as well as the insufﬁcient phase separation due to randomly postsulfonated structure. The synthesis of postsulfonated, hydroquinone- based diblock copolymers was investigated by means of highly reactive ﬂuorine-terminated reagents. The use of HQ led to some crystallinity and sol- ubility problems in the oligomer consisting of HQ and 4,40-dichlorodiphenyl sulfone. 4,40-Diﬂuorodi- phenyl sulfone was used as the termination rea- gent for the ether sulfone-based oligomer. It was found that intrinsic viscosity decreased with a higher molecular weight, even for the random copolymers. In contrast, decaﬂuorobiphenyl worked very effectively as the termination reagent and resulted in a successful synthesis of a diblock co- polymer with sufﬁcient molecular weight and intrinsic viscosity to form a tough membrane. Postsulfonation was successfully induced in the diblock copolymer without any degradation. It was observed that the degree of sulfonation was controllable by changing the reaction time. In addition, the postsulfonated diblock copolymer was conﬁrmed to have sufﬁcient thermal stability. The characterization results confirmed thermal stability at a temperature of at least 200 °C, T, of 156 °C and T,, of 247 °C. Additionally, tensile Journal of Polymer Science: Part A: Polymer Chemistry DOI 10.1002/pola strength at fracture was conﬁrmed to be 38.98 MPa even in the hydrated state.

      "property of 10F enabled the formation of kinky polymer chains that resulted in highly entangled polymeric physical structures, which would account for the high values. This successful diblock copolymer (B5, s-B5) is discussed in the fol- lowing section. The glass transition point (T,) of the 10F-based diblock copolymer was evaluated using DSC mea- surement by heating samples from 50 to 300 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min, as shown in Figure 11. Looking at the diblock copolymer before sulfonation, a peak due to T, was detected at 156 °C, corre- sponding to the PES block sequences, since it also appeared at almost the same temperature after sulfonation. A large peak also appeared at 247 °C, which is likely the melting point (7,,) mainly due Journal of Polymer Science: Part A: Polymer Chemistry DOI 10.1002/pola Before sulfonation 3 a ps T, 1s7¢ 4 After sulfonation 50 100 150 200 250 300 Temperature (degrees C) Figure 11.

This is because the sulfonate group associates and increases intermolecular interac- tion, hence reducing molecular mobility. The thermal decomposition point (Ty) was also studied using TGA measurement in a tempera- ture range from 50 to 400 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The results are shown in Figure 12. Although the diblock copolymer before sulfonation was stable until 300 °C without any weight loss, the sulfonated sample showed slight degradation at 200 °C, resulting in a 5% weight loss at 295 °C and a 10% weight loss at 340 °C. The Tq for this sulfonated diblock copolymer was lower than that reported in the reference.?” The reason can be explained by\n",

The solution was first heated to 60 °C for 4 h and then to 190 °C for 2 days. The filtered solution was kept in nitrogen gas without any isolation treat- ment until the coupling reaction. This oligomer is referred to as PEES in this article. BHPS (5.3192 g, 21.255 mmol), DFDPS (5.5311 g, 21.755 mmol), and KaCO3 (3.38 g, 24.5 mmol) were added to NMP (60 mL) with toluene (30 mL). The solution was first heated to 160 °C for 4 h and Figure 4 shows the coupling reaction of the diblock copolymer consisting of the PEES and PES-F oligomers. The stoichiometric ratio (1:1) of PEES to PES-F was calculated from the ideal molar numbers in each solution under the assumption that each could have a molecular weight of 20 kDa. Both prepared solutions were put in a flask in addition to a small amount of K,CO3 (equivalent to 1.15 times the amount of PEES) and toluene (half the volume of NMP). The solution mixture was heated to 130 °C for 6 h, and then the completion temperature was investi- gated by setting the temperature at various levels of 100, 130, 160, and 190 °C.

      "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Instead, these systems learn from and make decisions based on data. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. It is widely used in various fields such as speech recognition, image processing, and predictive analytics.\n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "Quantum computing is a type of computation that takes advantage of the principles of quantum mechanics, which is a fundamental theory in physics describing the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. Quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, instead of classical bits to process information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike classical bits, which can be either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in multiple states at once thanks to a property called superposition. This allows quantum computers to process a massive amount of possibilities simultaneously. Another key principle, entanglement, allows qubits that are entangled to influence one another instantaneously, regardless of the distance separating them, providing a powerful means to perform complex computations more efficiently than classical computers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computing holds promise for solving certain problems much faster than classical computers can. These include factoring large numbers, searching large databases, and simulating quantum physical processes. However, quantum computing is still largely in the experimental and developmental stages, with significant technical challenges remaining to be solved before it becomes practical for widespread use.\n",
