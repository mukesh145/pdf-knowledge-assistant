ABSTRACT: Sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) diblock copolymers were studied through the postsulfonation process. Two kinds of hydrophobic oligomers with a mol- ecular weight of 20 kDa were prepared in advance as block sequences and then coupled together to obtain diblock copolymers. One oligomer was synthesized from bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) sulfone (BHPS) and 4,40-diﬂuorodiphenyl sulfone (DFDPS), which was thought to be incapable of postsulfonation. The other oligomer was syn- thesized from hydroquinone (HQ) and 4,40-dichlorodiphenyl sulfone (DCDPS), which successfully proceeded to a hydrophilic sequence as a result of sulfonation onto the HQ moiety after the coupling reaction. Consequently, a diblock copolymer with high molecular weight was obtained; although its intrinsic viscosity was too low to form a tough membrane because of its high rigidity and high crystallinity. Therefore, the use of decaﬂuorobiphenyl (10F) as a termination reagent was investigated with the aim of achieving higher coupling reactivity and a kinky property. As a result, a sulfo- nated diblock copolymer was successfully obtained with sufﬁcient molecular weight and intrinsic viscosity to form the membrane, as well as with adequate thermal pro- perties. It was observed that proton conductivity, water uptake, and the water diffu- sion coefﬁcient increased with higher ion exchange capacity. VVC 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci Part A: Polym Chem 47: 700–712, 2009 For the last several decades, there has been increasing interest in polymer electrolyte mem- brane (PEM) fuel cells for application as station- ary, transportation, and portable power sources.1 Extensive research efforts have produced a wide variety of PEMs such as perﬂuorinated\\n\\nfunction of the reaction temperature. The existence ratio of PEES to PES-F at 100 °C [Fig. 8(1)] was calcu- lated to be around 20%, much lower than expected. Further, some partially insoluble prod- ucts were observed after isolation in methanol, leading to the same behavior as described before, presumably because there was a lot of unreacted PEES insoluble in NMP after isolation. It can be inferred that the product becomes soluble after isolation, only when the coupling reaction is suc- cessful, in spite of the insolubility of PEES. Fur- thermore, the result at 130 °C seemed to be almost the same as that at 100 °C. Therefore, a temperature of 160 °C or higher was found to be necessary to attain the coupling reaction. Looking at B, to By, in Table 1, the same tend- ency between M,, and IV is observed as in the ran- dom copolymers. The product (B,) polymerized at 190 °C with the highest M,, of 79.4 kDa had the lowest IV of 0.13-0.21 dL/g. With regard to postsulfonation application of these diblock copolymers, an attempt was made to sulfonate the product at 190 °C in the same way as the random copolymers. As a result, the sulfo- nated structure was identified as shown in Figure 8(5), while Figure 9 shows almost the same explanation for identifying the sulfonated diblock copolymers. Unfortunately, it was impossible to form a tough film because of the low IV, despite the high M,.

PES-10F was dissolved well in NMP (20 wt %) at 110 °C, and then PEES was added as well as KeCOs3 (equivalent to 1.15 times the volume of PEES), as indicated in Figure 6.

After drying in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 24 h, the membrane was immersed into deionized water for a while to detach it from the substrate and then boiled in 0.5 M sulfuric acid for 2h for acidification.

The solution was first heated to 60 °C for 4 h and then to 190 °C for 2 days. The filtered solution was kept in nitrogen gas without any isolation treat- ment until the coupling reaction.

The solution was first heated to 160 °C for 4 h and Figure 4 shows the coupling reaction of the diblock copolymer consisting of the PEES and PES-F oligomers. The stoichiometric ratio (1:1) of PEES to PES-F was calculated from the ideal molar numbers in each solution under the assumption that each could have a molecular weight of 20 kDa. Both prepared solutions were put in a flask in addition to a small amount of K,CO3 (equivalent to 1.15 times the amount of PEES) and toluene (half the volume of NMP). The solution mixture was heated to 130 °C for 6 h, and then the completion temperature was investi- gated by setting the temperature at various levels of 100, 130, 160, and 190 °C.

Although the diblock copolymer before sulfonation was stable until 300 °C without any weight loss, the sulfonated sample showed slight degradation at 200 °C, resulting in a 5% weight loss at 295 °C and a 10% weight loss at 340 °C.
